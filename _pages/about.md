> The illiterate of the 21st century will not be those who cannot read and write, but those who cannot learn, unlearn, and relearn. – _Alvin Toffler_

Hi 👋🏼, Thanks for dropping by!

My name's Kartikey, pronounced as _kaar-tih-kay_.

Most people pronounce it as **_carteakey_** instead - which sort of stuck with me and hence is the [site](https://carteakey.dev)'s name. 😬

## Work

I'm a Software Developer/Consultant from India. Much of my experience has been with clients in the **Supply Chain** & **Banking** industries, where I helped in the analysis, design & implementation of business applications.

My professional programming experience has been developing applications and automating stuff (the boring one, of course) in **Python**, **PL/SQL** & working with databases like **Oracle**, **Netezza**.

I won't bore you too much with my work history; that's what my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kartikeychauhan) is for.

## Passion

I’ve recently discovered my passion in Data Science and Machine Learning, and often try to create some [projects](https://carteakey.dev/projects) in that area.

## Interests / Hobbies

Outside of work, I try to strike a balance between tinkering with tech and having fun.

I like to write about linux, data science, and other things I find interesting, on this blog.

Gaming is one of the many ways I like to spend my free time. I am a huge Soulsborne fan, and love reading about intricate lore and mythical stuff (looking at you, Bloodborne)

## So, Yeah… That’s Me!

Feel free to [contact me](mailto: kartikeychauhan27@gmail.com) if you want to connect.
