> The illiterate of the 21st century will not be those who cannot read and write, but those who cannot learn, unlearn, and relearn. ‚Äì _Alvin Toffler_

Hi üëãüèº, Thanks for dropping by!

My name's Kartikey, pronounced like kaar-tih-kay.

Anglophonic people usually pronounce it as car-tea-key - which sort of stuck with me and hence is the [site](https://carteakey.dev)'s name.

## Work

I'm a Software Developer/Consultant from India. Much of my experience has been with clients in the **Supply Chain** & **Banking** industries, where I helped in the analysis, design & implementation of business applications.

My professional programming experience has been developing applications and automating stuff (the boring one, of course) in **Python**, **PL/SQL**, working with databases like **Oracle**, **Netezza**.

I won't bore you too much with my work history; that's what my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kartikeychauhan) is for.

## Passion

I‚Äôve recently discovered my passion in Data Science and Machine Learning, and often try to create some [projects](https://carteakey.dev/projects) in that area.

With the ever-expanding world of Data Science and Machine Learning, it brings with itself more and more potential to learn and explore uncharted territories, and i am excited to see what the future holds.

## Interests / Hobbies

Outside of work, I try to strike a balance between tinkering with tech and having fun.

I like to write about linux, data science, and other things I find interesting, on this blog.

Gaming is one of the many ways I like to spend my free time. I am a huge Soulsborne fan, and love reading about intricate lore and mythical stuff (looking at you, Bloodborne)

## So, Yeah‚Ä¶ That‚Äôs Me!

Hey, you. You‚Äôre finally awake. You were trying to cross the border, right? Walked right into that Imperial ambush, same as us, and that thief over there.
